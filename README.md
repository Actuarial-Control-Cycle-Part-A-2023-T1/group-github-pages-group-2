## **Overview**

Storslysia is acutely threatened by the impact of natural disasters that are increasing 
over time due to climate change. The leaders of Storslysia are highly motivated to manage the 
risks associated with such catastrophes and wish to consider implementing a 
social relocation insurance program to help manage its exposure to the financial impacts of mass 
displacement.
This page outlines the proposed social relocation insurance program available to all citizens for 
voluntary relocation to help Storslysia manage its exposure to displacement risk 
arising from catastrophic climate-related events.

### **Key Objectives**

There are 3 key objectives for the proposed program:
1. To provide coverage for all citizens of Storslysia against the financial impacts of emergency
displacement.
2. To encourage voluntary, proactive relocation to less risky geographic regions to reduce  economic costs with a high degree of certainty. 
3. To prevent costs arising from relocation (voluntary or catastrophe-related 
displacement) from exceeding 10% of Storslysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) each 
year with a high degree of certainty.

### **Key Metrics**

The following key metrics will be used to monitor the program’s success annually
over the short-term (2023-2028) and long-term (2023-2053) time frames:
1. Number of claims and amounts paid out by each region. 
2. Percentage of population voluntarily relocating by region.
3. Reduction in economic costs of involuntary relocation by region. 
4. Reduction in percentage of GDP expended on relocation. 

### **Key Assumptions**

**Financial Assumptions**

* Inflation: Short term inflation of 3.85% in 2023 is assumed which linearly transitions to a 
long-term baseline at 2.00%. Scenario loadings are applied for the long-term rate.
* Risk-free yields: short term risk-free rates are assumed at 0.79% in 2023 which linearly 
transition to a long-term baseline at 2.50%. Scenario loadings are applied for the long-term rate.
* Historical Population Growth Rate: from years 1960-2020, we assumed that population 
grew at a rate of 0.85% yearly. This was selected based on the projected population 
growth rates for future years provided.

**Relocation Assumptions**

A significant assumption for our voluntary program is that it will cause the population of 
Storslysia to relocate towards safer regions. Hence, we have implemented a relocation model 
with the following assumptions.

* We have assumed that the population of Storylsia will be able to relocate to different 
regions at the start of each year.
* The rates of relocation are decided by a pre-determined matrix transition rate which 
specifies the percentage of a region will relocate with respect to its population.
* This relocation matrix is constant and does not change as the program develops.

We have designed this matrix to replicate the goals of the program and was 
informed by our region risk analysis. More specifically, to move Storylsias citizens away from 
high-risk regions to low-risk regions.

**Yearly Incentives**

Incentive amounts are fixed for each region throughout the program’s timeframe. This is done 
to simplify calculations. To see the assumed yearly incentives. The value of 
these incentives directly influences the costs of the program, as a result, they have a significant 
impact on the projected costs.

**Distribution Assumptions**

* Relocation severity for each hazard event classification (minor, medium or major) is 
assumed to be constant and equal to the estimate based on historical values, with only 
inflation indexing. This is a significant assumption that would impact the variability of 
our total claim cost.
* Hazard event frequency is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution and grows as per the 
projection model provided. Poisson is a natural distribution to use for count data and is 
common practice in the insurance industry.
