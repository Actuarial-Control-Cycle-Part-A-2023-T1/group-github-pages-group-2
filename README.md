## Overview

Storslysia is acutely threatened by the impact of natural disasters that are increasing 
over time due to climate change. The leaders of Storslysia are highly motivated to manage the 
risks associated with such catastrophes and wish to consider implementing a 
social relocation insurance program to help manage its exposure to the financial impacts of mass 
displacement.
This page outlines the proposed social relocation insurance program available to all citizens for 
voluntary relocation to help Storslysia manage its exposure to displacement risk 
arising from catastrophic climate-related events.

### Key Objectives

There are 3 key objectives for the proposed program:
1. To provide coverage for all citizens of Storslysia against the financial impacts of emergency
displacement.
2. To encourage voluntary, proactive relocation to less risky geographic regions to reduce  economic costs with a high degree of certainty. 
3. To prevent costs arising from relocation (voluntary or catastrophe-related 
displacement) from exceeding 10% of Storslysiaâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) each 
year with a high degree of certainty.
