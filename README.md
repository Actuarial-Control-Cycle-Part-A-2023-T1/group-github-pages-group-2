## Overview

Storslysia is acutely threatened by the impact of natural disasters that are increasing 
over time due to climate change. The leaders of Storslysia are highly motivated to manage the 
risks associated with such catastrophes and wish to consider implementing a 
social relocation insurance program to help manage its exposure to the financial impacts of mass 
displacement.
This page outlines the proposed social relocation insurance program available to all citizens for 
voluntary relocation to help Storslysia manage its exposure to displacement risk 
arising from catastrophic climate-related events. The program aims to do this by providing monetary 
incentives for citizens to move out of high-risk geographic regions
